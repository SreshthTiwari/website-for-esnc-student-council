This repository contains the project files for the website of the ESNC
Student Council 2020-21. The wbesite provides a friendly interface through which the students can interact with the council - they can share their ideas, opinions, suggestions and more, directly with the Student Council.

The website also contains information about each member of the council, i.e, their hobbies, interests, etc., new initiatives being taken up by the council, along with upcoming events or competitions in the school.

The website is static, but uses formsubmit to receive mails containing the students ideas.
